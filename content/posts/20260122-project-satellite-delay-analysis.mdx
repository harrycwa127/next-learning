## Satellite Delay Analysis

This project is Fully self developed for University FYP with python for calculate the delay of data transfer delay between ground station though LEO satellite.

### Features

- parameter setting with UI (setting data for orbit generation)
- set ground station and observation points etc data in file
- calculate delay for different path selection algorithm
- show result in 3D images
